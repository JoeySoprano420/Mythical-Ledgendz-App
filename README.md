To enhance the workflow for allowing a user to sign in directly to GitHub through a sub-menu and instantly grant permissions, you can leverage GitHub Actions' ability to interact with external services via OAuth or similar authentication mechanisms. However, it's important to note that GitHub Actions workflows are intended for automated processes and may not be the best tool for interactive user logins.

That said, you can integrate GitHub OAuth to obtain tokens and use these tokens in your workflow. Hereâ€™s an outline of how to achieve this:

1. **Set up OAuth Application**: Create a GitHub OAuth application to get the client ID and client secret.
2. **Create a Sign-in Menu**: A simple web interface where users can sign in to GitHub and grant the necessary permissions.
3. **Token Exchange**: Exchange the OAuth code for an access token.
4. **Use the Token in GitHub Actions**: Store the token in GitHub Secrets and use it in your workflows.

### Step 1: Set Up OAuth Application

1. Go to [GitHub Developer Settings](https://github.com/settings/developers) and create a new OAuth application.
2. Note the **Client ID** and **Client Secret**.

### Step 2: Create a Sign-in Menu

Create a simple web application (e.g., using Node.js and Express) to handle GitHub OAuth sign-in.

**`app.js`**:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const axios = require('axios');
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

const clientID = 'YOUR_CLIENT_ID';
const clientSecret = 'YOUR_CLIENT_SECRET';
const redirectURI = 'http://localhost:3000/callback';

app.get('/login', (req, res) => {
  const githubAuthURL = `https://github.com/login/oauth/authorize?client_id=${clientID}&redirect_uri=${redirectURI}`;
  res.redirect(githubAuthURL);
});

app.get('/callback', async (req, res) => {
  const requestToken = req.query.code;
  const tokenResponse = await axios.post(`https://github.com/login/oauth/access_token`, {
    client_id: clientID,
    client_secret: clientSecret,
    code: requestToken
  }, {
    headers: { 'Accept': 'application/json' }
  });
  const accessToken = tokenResponse.data.access_token;
  res.send(`Your token is ${accessToken}. Save it securely.`);
});

app.listen(port, () => {
  console.log(`App listening at http://localhost:${port}`);
});
```

Run this application and navigate to `http://localhost:3000/login` to initiate the OAuth flow.

### Step 3: Token Exchange

Once the user logs in and grants permissions, they will receive an access token. This token should be securely stored.

### Step 4: Use the Token in GitHub Actions

Store the token in GitHub Secrets:
1. Go to your GitHub repository.
2. Navigate to **Settings** > **Secrets and variables** > **Actions**.
3. Add a new secret named `GITHUB_TOKEN_OAUTH` and paste the access token.

### Step 5: Update Workflow to Use the Token

Update your GitHub Actions workflow to use the stored token.

**`.github/workflows/nodejs-package.yml`**:

```yaml
name: Node.js Package

on:
  release:
    types: [created]

jobs:
  build:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          cache: 'npm'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Run tests
        run: npm test

  publish-gpr:
    needs: build
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    permissions:
      contents: read
      packages: write
    steps:
      - name: Checkout code
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Set up Node.js
        uses: actions/setup-node@v3
        with:
          node-version: '16'
          registry-url: 'https://npm.pkg.github.com/'

      - name: Install dependencies
        run: npm ci

      - name: Publish package
        run: npm publish
        env:
          NODE_AUTH_TOKEN: ${{secrets.GITHUB_TOKEN_OAUTH}}
```

This setup allows a user to authenticate through GitHub, obtain an access token, and use it in GitHub Actions to perform tasks like publishing packages. Make sure to securely handle the OAuth tokens and ensure your web application does not expose sensitive information.
